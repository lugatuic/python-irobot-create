##python-irobot-create

This project is new. Bear with me for a bit while I get it started. If you want to get started right away with an iRobot Create I reccomend trying https://github.com/mgobryan/pycreate which I will be using heavily as a reference for how to communicate with the robot though I won't be using any code from it.
